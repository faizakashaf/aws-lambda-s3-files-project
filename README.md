üìÇ **AWS Lambda + S3 + SNS Notification Project**

**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates how to automatically send notifications whenever a file is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket, using AWS Lambda and SNS (Simple Notification Service).
It showcases a simple event-driven architecture without using any servers ‚Äî fully serverless

**Workflow**
A file is uploaded to a specified S3 bucket.
S3 Event Notification triggers a Lambda function.

Reads the event metadata (bucket name, file key, etc.).
Publishes a message to an SNS topic.
SNS delivers the notification to its subscribed endpoints (can be email, SMS, etc.).

**Technologies Used**
AWS S3 (Storage)
AWS Lambda (Serverless Compute)
AWS SNS (Messaging Service)
Python (Lambda function code)
IAM Roles and Policies (for permissions)

**Setup Instructions**
1. Create an S3 Bucket
Create a bucket to store files.
Block all public access for security.
2. Create an SNS Topic

Subscribe your email/SMS if you want to receive notifications.

**Create the Lambda Function**
Runtime: Python 3.12
Environment Variable: SNS_TOPIC_ARN (your SNS Topic ARN)

**Attach Required IAM Permissions**

Read from S3 events
Publish to SNS topics
